For example, instead of <code>my-image:latest</code>, it is\nbetter to use <code>my-image:1.2.3-alpine</code> or <code>my-image:1.2.3</code>.</p>\n<p>For even more control and traceability, it is also possible to specify your image by digest using the sha256 of the image. This will pin your image\nto a specific version in time, but will also exclude it from eventual security updates. An example would be using\n<code>my-image@sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d</code>.</p>\n<p>More information can be found in the documentation at the end.</p>\n\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: nginx\n      image: nginx # Noncompliant\n\n    - name: nginx\n      image: nginx:latest # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: nginx\n      image: nginx:1.14.2 # Compliant, fixed tag\n\n    - name: nginx\n      image: nginx@sha256:b0ad43f7ee5edbc0effbc14645ae7055e21bc1973aee5150745632a24a752661 # Compliant, SHA of the image\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>This way, the same version of the container image is used every time the application is built, deployed, or run, ensuring consistency and\npredictability across different environments. It is also not enough to use the latest tag, as this version also changes with each release.</p>\n<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>\n<p>Adhering to this can also make it easier to track which version of the container image is being used, which can be useful for debugging and\ntroubleshooting purposes.</p>\n<p>While using always the latest version may seem convenient, the build cannot be repeated because it is not clear which was the last version. In\naddition, it can lead to unpredictability and issues such as version mismatch and potential security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>For example, if a developer builds and deploys an application using <code>my-image:latest</code>, they may unknowingly be using a different version\nof the image than another developer who also built and deployed the same application using <code>my-image:latest</code>. This can lead to version\nmismatches, which can cause bugs or compatibility issues.</p>\n<p>In addition, using <code>latest</code> as the tag for container images can potentially introduce security vulnerabilities. For instance, if a\nsecurity vulnerability is discovered in an image and a new version is released to fix it, using <code>latest</code> as the tag means that the\napplication will automatically use the updated image, even if it has not been properly tested and vetted for compatibility with the application.</p>",

For instance, a container\nmight not get the resources it needs to function correctly, leading to performance issues or even failure of the container.</p>\n<h4>System Instability</h4>\n<p>In the worst-case scenario, if a container uses more resources than a node can handle (due to lack of defined requests), it can cause the node to\nrun out of resources. In this case, Kubernetes may throttle its CPU usage. By setting a CPU request, Kubernetes will make sure that the container will\nget the requested CPU.</p>\n<p>To avoid potential issues, either specify a CPU request for each container with <code>resources.requests.cpu</code> or create a resource of a kind\n<code>LimitRange</code> that sets a default CPU request for all containers in all pod specifications in a namespace.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: web # Noncompliant\n      image: nginx\n</pre>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: web # Noncompliant\n      image: nginx\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: web\n      image: nginx\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          cpu: 0.5\n</pre>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\napiVersion: v1\nkind: LimitRange\nmetadata:\n  name: cpu-request-range\n  namespace: default-cpu-example\nspec:\n  limits:\n  - defaultRequest:\n      cpu: 0.5\n    type: Container\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-ns-compliant\n  namespace: default-cpu-example\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx-ns-compliant\n    image: nginx\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>A request can be set through the property <code>resources.requests.cpu</code> of a container. Alternatively, a default request for a namespace can\nbe set with <code>LimitRange</code> through the property <code>spec.limits[].defaultRequest.cpu</code>.</p>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> Kubernetes Documentation - <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/cpu-default-namespace/\">Configure\n  Default CPU Requests and Limits for a Namespace</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Articles &amp; blog posts</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> Google Cloud Blog - <a\n  href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits\">Kubernetes best\n  practices: Resource requests and limits</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>A CPU request is a configuration that sets the guaranteed amount of CPU cores that a container will be able to use. It is part of the resource\nmanagement functionality of Kubernetes, which allows for the control and allocation of computational resources to containers.</p>\n<p>When a CPU request is set for a container, Kubernetes will only schedule it on a node that can give it that resource, thereby guaranteeing that the\ncontainer can use the specified requested CPU cores.</p>",
